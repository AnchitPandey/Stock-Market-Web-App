# Stock Market Web App

This app allows the user to query an organzation and view its stock details. I developed this app with Angular Material as front-end and Node.js as Backend. The Angular app sends request to Node backend which inturn sends request to 3rd party APIs like Tiingo, NewsAPI and HighStocks API.

## Features of the App
