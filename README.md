# Features of Stock Market Web App

This app allows the user to query an organzation and view its stock details. I developed this app with Angular Material as front-end and Express.js as Backend. The Express endpoints call various 3rd party APIs like Tiingo, NewsAPI and HighStock to fetch company specific data.
